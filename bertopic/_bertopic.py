class BERTopic:
    """BERTopic is a topic modeling technique that leverages BERT embeddings and
    c-TF-IDF to create dense clusters allowing for easily interpretable topics
    whilst keeping important words in the topic descriptions.

    The default embedding model is `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` when selecting `language="english"`
    and `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` when selecting `language="multilingual"`.

    Attributes:
        topics_ (List[int]) : The topics that are generated for each document after training or updating
                              the topic model. The most recent topics are tracked.
        probabilities_ (List[float]): The probability of the assigned topic per document. These are
                                      only calculated if a HDBSCAN model is used for the clustering step.
                                      When `calculate_probabilities=True`, then it is the probabilities
                                      of all topics per document.
        topic_sizes_ (Mapping[int, int]) : The size of each topic.
        topic_mapper_ (TopicMapper) : A class for tracking topics and their mappings anytime they are
                                      merged, reduced, added, or removed.
        topic_representations_ (Mapping[int, Tuple[int, float]]) : The top n terms per topic and their respective
                                                                   c-TF-IDF values.
        c_tf_idf_ (csr_matrix) : The topic-term matrix as calculated through c-TF-IDF. To access its respective
                                 words, run `.vectorizer_model.get_feature_names()`  or
                                 `.vectorizer_model.get_feature_names_out()`
        topic_labels_ (Mapping[int, str]) : The default labels for each topic.
        custom_labels_ (List[str]) : Custom labels for each topic.
        topic_embeddings_ (np.ndarray) : The embeddings for each topic. They are calculated by taking the
                                         centroid embedding of each cluster.
        representative_docs_ (Mapping[int, str]) : The representative documents for each topic.

    Examples:
    ```python
    from bertopic import BERTopic
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups

    docs = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all')['data']
    topic_model = BERTopic()
    topics, probabilities = topic_model.fit_transform(docs)
    ```

    If you want to use your own embedding model, use it as follows:

    ```python
    from bertopic import BERTopic
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

    docs = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all')['data']
    sentence_model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
    topic_model = BERTopic(embedding_model=sentence_model)
    ```

    Due to the stochastic nature of UMAP, the results from BERTopic might differ
    and the quality can degrade. Using your own embeddings allows you to
    try out BERTopic several times until you find the topics that suit
    you best.

        Arguments:
            language: The main language used in your documents. The default sentence-transformers
                      model for "english" is `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`. For a full overview of
                      supported languages see bertopic.backend.languages. Select
                      "multilingual" to load in the `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`
                      sentence-transformers model that supports 50+ languages.
                      NOTE: This is not used if `embedding_model` is used.
            top_n_words: The number of words per topic to extract. Setting this
                         too high can negatively impact topic embeddings as topics
                         are typically best represented by at most 10 words.
            n_gram_range: The n-gram range for the CountVectorizer.
                          Advised to keep high values between 1 and 3.
                          More would likely lead to memory issues.
                          NOTE: This param will not be used if you pass in your own
                          CountVectorizer.
            min_topic_size: The minimum size of the topic. Increasing this value will lead
                            to a lower number of clusters/topics and vice versa.
                            It is the same parameter as `min_cluster_size` in HDBSCAN.
                            NOTE: This param will not be used if you are using `hdbscan_model`.
            nr_topics: Specifying the number of topics will reduce the initial
                       number of topics to the value specified. This reduction can take
                       a while as each reduction in topics (-1) activates a c-TF-IDF
                       calculation. If this is set to None, no reduction is applied. Use
                       "auto" to automatically reduce topics using HDBSCAN.
                       NOTE: Controlling the number of topics is best done by adjusting
                       `min_topic_size` first before adjusting this parameter.
            low_memory: Sets UMAP low memory to True to make sure less memory is used.
                        NOTE: This is only used in UMAP. For example, if you use PCA instead of UMAP
                        this parameter will not be used.
            calculate_probabilities: Calculate the probabilities of all topics
                                     per document instead of the probability of the assigned
                                     topic per document. This could slow down the extraction
                                     of topics if you have many documents (> 100_000).
                                     NOTE: If false you cannot use the corresponding
                                     visualization method `visualize_probabilities`.
                                     NOTE: This is an approximation of topic probabilities
                                     as used in HDBSCAN and not an exact representation.
            seed_topic_list: A list of seed words per topic to converge around
            zeroshot_topic_list: A list of topic names to use for zero-shot classification
            zeroshot_min_similarity: The minimum similarity between a zero-shot topic and
                                     a document for assignment. The higher this value, the more
                                     confident the model needs to be to assign a zero-shot topic to a document.
            verbose: Changes the verbosity of the model, Set to True if you want
                     to track the stages of the model.
            embedding_model: Use a custom embedding model.

        """Fit BERTopic on a subset of the data and perform online learning
        with batch-like data.

        Online topic modeling in BERTopic is performed by using dimensionality
        reduction and cluster algorithms that support a `partial_fit` method
        in order to incrementally train the topic model.

        Likewise, the `bertopic.vectorizers.OnlineCountVectorizer` is used
        to dynamically update its vocabulary when presented with new data.
        It has several parameters for modeling decay and updating the
        representations.

        In other words, although the main algorithm stays the same, the training
        procedure now works as follows:

        For each subset of the data:

        1. Generate embeddings with a pre-trained language model
        2. Incrementally update the dimensionality reduction algorithm with `partial_fit`
        3. Incrementally update the cluster algorithm with `partial_fit`
        4. Incrementally update the OnlineCountVectorizer and apply some form of decay

        Note that it is advised to use `partial_fit` with batches and
        not single documents for the best performance.

        Arguments:
            documents: A list of documents to fit on
            embeddings: Pre-trained document embeddings. These can be used
                        instead of the sentence-transformer model
            y: The target class for (semi)-supervised modeling. Use -1 if no class for a

        averaged with the global c-TF-IDF representations in order to fine-tune the
        local representations.

        Note:
            Make sure to use a limited number of unique timestamps (<100) as the
            c-TF-IDF representation will be calculated at each single unique timestamp.
            Having a large number of unique timestamps can take some time to be calculated.
            Moreover, there aren't many use-cases where you would like to see the difference

        Arguments:
            docs: The documents you used when calling either `fit` or `fit_transform`

                        ascending order.
            topics: A list of topics where each topic is related to a document in `docs` and
                    a timestamp in `timestamps`. You can use this to apply topics_over_time on
                    a subset of the data. Make sure that `docs`, `timestamps`, and `topics`
                    all correspond to one another and have the same size.
            nr_bins: The number of bins you want to create for the timestamps. The left interval will
                     be chosen as the timestamp. An additional column will be created with the
                     entire interval.
            datetime_format: The datetime format of the timestamps if they are strings, eg “%d/%m/%Y”.
                             Set this to None if you want to have it automatically detect the format.
                             See strftime documentation for more information on choices:

                              evolutionary topic representations.
            global_tuning: Fine-tune each topic representation at timestamp *t* by averaging its c-TF-IDF matrix
                       with the global c-TF-IDF matrix. Turn this off if you want to prevent words in

        In order to perform this approximation, each document is split into tokens
        according to the provided tokenizer in the `CountVectorizer`. Then, a
        sliding window is applied on each document creating subsets of the document.
        For example, with a window size of 3 and stride of 1, the sentence:

        `Solving the right problem is difficult.`

        can be split up into `solving the right`, `the right problem`, `right problem is`,
        and `problem is difficult`. These are called tokensets. For each of these
        tokensets, we calculate their c-TF-IDF representation and find out
        how similar they are to the previously generated topics. Then, the
        similarities to the topics for each tokenset are summed up in order to
        create a topic distribution for the entire document.

        We can also dive into this a bit deeper by then splitting these tokensets
        up into individual tokens and calculate how much a word, in a specific sentence,
        contributes to the topics found in that document. This can be enabled by
        setting `calculate_tokens=True` which can be used for visualization purposes
        in `topic_model.visualize_approximate_distribution`.

        The main output, `topic_distributions`, can also be used directly in

        a single distribution.

                    tokens being considered.
            stride: How far the window should move at each step.
            min_similarity: The minimum similarity of a document's tokenset
                            with respect to the topics.
            batch_size: The number of documents to process at a time. If None,
                        then all documents are processed at once.

                        advised to process all documents at once.
            padding: Whether to pad the beginning and ending of a document with
                     empty tokens.
            use_embedding_model: Whether to use the topic model's embedding
                                 model to calculate the similarity between
                                 tokensets and topics instead of using c-TF-IDF.
            calculate_tokens: Calculate the similarity of tokens with all topics.
                              NOTE: This is computation-wise more expensive and
                              can require more memory. Using this over batches of
                              documents might be preferred.
            separator: The separator used to merge tokens into tokensets.

        Returns:
            topic_distributions: A `n` x `m` matrix containing the topic distributions
                                 for all input documents with `n` being the documents
                                 and `m` the topics.
            topic_token_distributions: A list of `t` x `m` arrays with `t` being the
                                       number of tokens for the respective document
                                       and `m` the topics.

        Examples:
        After fitting the model, the topic distributions can be calculated regardless
        of the clustering model and regardless of whether the documents were previously
        seen or not:

        ```python
        topic_distr, _ = topic_model.approximate_distribution(docs)
        ```

        As a result, the topic distributions are calculated in `topic_distr` for the
        entire document based on a token set with a specific window size and stride.

        If you want to calculate the topic distributions on a token-level:

        ```python
        topic_distr, topic_token_distr = topic_model.approximate_distribution(docs, calculate_tokens=True)
        ```

        The `topic_token_distr` then contains, for each token, the best fitting topics.
        As with `topic_distr`, it can contain multiple topics for a single token.

                         are typically best represented by at most 10 words.

        Examples:
        In order to update the topic representation, you will need to first fit the topic
        model and extract topics from them. Based on these, you can update the representation:

        ```python
        topic_model.update_topics(docs, n_gram_range=(2, 3))

        You can also use a custom vectorizer to update the representation:

                          in the dictionary.

        Examples:
        First, we define our topic labels with `.generate_topic_labels` in which

        ```python
        topic_labels = topic_model.generate_topic_labels(nr_words=2,

        Then, we pass these `topic_labels` to our topic model which
        can be accessed at any time with `.custom_labels_`:

        ```python
        topic_model.set_topic_labels(topic_labels)
        topic_model.custom_labels_
        ```

        You might want to change only a few topic labels instead of all of them.
        To do so, you can pass a dictionary where the keys are the topic IDs and
        its keys the topic labels:

        ```python
        topic_model.set_topic_labels({0: "Space", 1: "Sports", 2: "Medicine"})

        to one of several strategies.

        When using HDBSCAN, DBSCAN, or OPTICS, a number of outlier documents might be created
        that do not fall within any of the created topics. These are labeled as -1.
        This function allows the user to match outlier documents with their nearest topic
        using one of the following strategies using the `strategy` parameter:
            * "probabilities"
                This uses the soft-clustering as performed by HDBSCAN to find the
                best matching topic for each outlier document. To use this, make
                sure to calculate the `probabilities` beforehand by instantiating
                BERTopic with `calculate_probabilities=True`.
            * "distributions"
                Use the topic distributions, as calculated with `.approximate_distribution`
                to find the most frequent topic in each outlier document. You can use the
                `distributions_params` variable to tweak the parameters of
                `.approximate_distribution`.
            * "c-tf-idf"
                Calculate the c-TF-IDF representation for each outlier document and
                find the best matching c-TF-IDF topic representation using
                cosine similarity.
            * "embeddings"
                Using the embeddings of each outlier documents, find the best
                matching topic embedding using cosine similarity.

        Arguments:
            documents: A list of documents for which we reduce or remove the outliers.
            topics: The topics that correspond to the documents
            images: A list of paths to the images used when calling either
                    `fit` or `fit_transform`
            strategy: The strategy used for reducing outliers.
                    Options:
                        * "probabilities"
                            This uses the soft-clustering as performed by HDBSCAN
                            to find the best matching topic for each outlier document.

                        * "distributions"
                            Use the topic distributions, as calculated with `.approximate_distribution`
                            to find the most frequent topic in each outlier document.

                        * "c-tf-idf"
                            Calculate the c-TF-IDF representation for outlier documents and
                            find the best matching c-TF-IDF topic representation.

                        * "embeddings"
                            Calculate the embeddings for outlier documents and
                            find the best matching topic embedding.
            probabilities: Probabilities generated by HDBSCAN for each document when using the strategy `"probabilities"`.
            threshold: The threshold for assigning topics to outlier documents. This value
                       represents the minimum probability when `strategy="probabilities"`.
                       For all other strategies, it represents the minimum similarity.
            embeddings: The pre-computed embeddings to be used when `strategy="embeddings"`.
                        If this is None, then it will compute the embeddings for the outlier documents.
            distributions_params: The parameters used in `.approximate_distribution` when using
                                  the strategy `"distributions"`.

        Arguments:
            docs: The documents you used when calling either `fit` or `fit_transform`
            hierarchical_topics: A dataframe that contains a hierarchy of topics
                                represented by their parents and their children
            topics: A selection of topics to visualize.
                    Not to be confused with the topics that you get from `.fit_transform`.
                    For example, if you want to visualize only topics 1 through 5:
                    `topics = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
            embeddings: The embeddings of all documents in `docs`.
            reduced_embeddings: The 2D reduced embeddings of all documents in `docs`.
            sample: The percentage of documents in each topic that you would like to keep.
                    Value can be between 0 and 1. Setting this value to, for example,
                    0.1 (10% of documents in each topic) makes it easier to visualize
                    millions of documents as a subset is chosen.
            hide_annotations: Hide the names of the traces on top of each cluster.
            hide_document_hover: Hide the content of the documents when hovering over
                                 specific points. Helps to speed up generation of visualizations.
            nr_levels: The number of levels to be visualized in the hierarchy. First, the distances
                       in `hierarchical_topics.Distance` are split in `nr_levels` lists of distances with
                       equal length. Then, for each list of distances, the merged topics, that have
                       a distance less or equal to the maximum distance of the selected list of distances, are selected.
                       NOTE: To get all possible merged steps, make sure that `nr_levels` is equal to
                       the length of `hierarchical_topics`.
            level_scale: Whether to apply a linear or logarithmic ('log') scale levels of the distance
                         vector. Linear scaling will perform an equal number of merges at each level
                         while logarithmic scaling will perform more mergers in earlier levels to
                         provide more resolution at higher levels (this can be used for when the number
                         of topics is large).
            custom_labels: Whether to use custom topic labels that were defined using
                           `topic_model.set_topic_labels`.
                           NOTE: Custom labels are only generated for the original

        The models are merged as if they were all saved using pytorch or

        To do this, we choose the first model in the list of
        models as a baseline. Then, we check each model whether
        they contain topics that are not in the baseline.
        This check is based on the cosine similarity between
        topics embeddings. If topic embeddings between two models
        are similar, then the topic of the second model is re-assigned
        to the first. If they are dissimilar, the topic of the second
        model is assigned to the first.

So I went a bit overboard\ud83d\ude05... and created an animation about the three pillars of BERTopic using Manim. There are many other visualizations added, one of each variation of BERTopic, and many smaller changes. </p> Topic Distributions <p>The difficulty with a cluster-based topic modeling technique is that it does not directly consider that documents may contain multiple topics. With the new release, we can now model the distributions of topics! We even consider that a single word might be related to multiple topics. If a document is a mixture of topics, what is preventing a single word to be the same? </p> <p>To do so, we approximate the distribution of topics in a document by calculating and summing the similarities of tokensets (achieved by applying a sliding window) with the topics:</p> <pre><code># After fitting your model run the following for either your trained documents or even unseen documents\ntopic_distr, _ = topic_model.approximate_distribution(docs)\n</code></pre> <p>To calculate and visualize the topic distributions in a document on a token-level, we can run the following:</p> <pre><code># We need to calculate the topic distributions on a token level\ntopic_distr, topic_token_distr = topic_model.approximate_distribution(docs, calculate_tokens=True)\n\n# Create a visualization using a styled dataframe if Jinja2 is installed\ndf = topic_model.visualize_approximate_distribution(docs[0], topic_token_distr[0]); df\n</code></pre> Supervised Topic Modeling <p>BERTopic now supports fully-supervised classification! Instead of using a clustering algorithm, like HDBSCAN, we can replace it with a classifier, like Logistic Regression:</p> <pre><code>from bertopic import BERTopic\nfrom bertopic.dimensionality import BaseDimensionalityReduction\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\n# Get labeled data\ndata= fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all',  remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes'))\ndocs = data['data']\ny = data['target']\n\n# Allows us to skip over the dimensionality reduction step\nempty_dimensionality_model = BaseDimensionalityReduction()\n\n# Create a classifier to be used instead of the cluster model\nclf= LogisticRegression()\n\n# Create a fully supervised BERTopic instance\ntopic_model= BERTopic(\n        umap_model=empty_dimensionality_model,\n        hdbscan_model=clf\n)\ntopics, probs = topic_model.fit_transform(docs, y=y)\n</code></pre> Manual Topic Modeling <p>When you already have a bunch of labels and simply want to extract topic representations from them, you might not need to actually learn how those can predicted. We can bypass the <code>embeddings -&gt; dimensionality reduction -&gt; clustering</code> steps and go straight to the c-TF-IDF representation of our labels:</p> <pre><code>from bertopic import BERTopic\nfrom bertopic.backend import BaseEmbedder\nfrom bertopic.cluster import BaseCluster\nfrom bertopic.dimensionality import BaseDimensionalityReduction\n\n# Prepare our empty sub-models and reduce frequent words while we are at it.\nempty_embedding_model = BaseEmbedder()\nempty_dimensionality_model = BaseDimensionalityReduction()\nempty_cluster_model = BaseCluster()\n\n# Fit BERTopic without actually performing any clustering\ntopic_model= BERTopic(\n        embedding_model=empty_embedding_model,\n        umap_model=empty_dimensionality_model,\n        hdbscan_model=empty_cluster_model,\n)\ntopics, probs = topic_model.fit_transform(docs, y=y)\n</code></pre> Outlier Reduction <p>Outlier reduction is an frequently-discussed topic in BERTopic as its default cluster model, HDBSCAN, has a tendency to generate many outliers. This often helps in the topic representation steps, as we do not consider documents that are less relevant, but you might want to still assign those outliers to actual topics. In the modular philosophy of BERTopic, keeping training times in mind, it is now possible to perform outlier reduction after having trained your topic model. This allows for ease of iteration and prevents having to train BERTopic many times to find the parameters you are searching for. There are 4 different strategies that you can use, so make sure to check out the documentation!</p> <p>Using it is rather straightforward:</p> <pre><code>new_topics = topic_model.reduce_outliers(docs, topics)\n</code></pre> Lightweight BERTopic <p>The default embedding model in BERTopic is one of the amazing sentence-transformers models, namely <code>\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"</code>. Although this model performs well out of the box, it typically needs a GPU to transform the documents into embeddings in a reasonable time. Moreover, the installation requires <code>pytorch</code> which often results in a rather large environment, memory-wise. </p> <p>Fortunately, it is possible to install BERTopic without <code>sentence-transformers</code> and use it as a lightweight solution instead. The installation can be done as follows:</p> <pre><code>pip install --no-deps bertopic\npip install --upgrade numpy hdbscan umap-learn pandas scikit-learn tqdm plotly pyyaml\n</code></pre> <p>Then, we can use BERTopic without <code>sentence-transformers</code> as follows using a CPU-based embedding technique:</p> <pre><code>from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n\npipe = make_pipeline(\n    TfidfVectorizer(),\n    TruncatedSVD(100)\n)\n\ntopic_model = BERTopic(embedding_model=pipe)\n</code></pre> <p>As a result, the entire package and resulting model can be run quickly on the CPU and no GPU is necessary!</p> Document Information <p>Get information about the documents on which the topic was trained including the documents themselves, their respective topics, the name of each topic, the top n words of each topic, whether it is a representative document, and the probability of the clustering if the cluster model supports it.

Essentially, it is a way to update your topic model with data on which it was not trained on before. In Scikit-Learn, this technique is often modeled through a <code>.partial_fit</code> function, which is also used in BERTopic. </p> <p>At a minimum, the cluster model needs to support a <code>.partial_fit</code> function in order to use this feature. The default HDBSCAN model will not work as it does not support online updating. </p> <pre><code>from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\nfrom sklearn.cluster import MiniBatchKMeans\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import IncrementalPCA\nfrom bertopic.vectorizers import OnlineCountVectorizer\nfrom bertopic import BERTopic\n\n# Prepare documents\nall_docs = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=subset,  remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes'))[\"data\"]\ndoc_chunks = [all_docs[i:i+1000] for i in range(0, len(all_docs), 1000)]\n\n# Prepare sub-models that support online learning\numap_model = IncrementalPCA(n_components=5)\ncluster_model = MiniBatchKMeans(n_clusters=50, random_state=0)\nvectorizer_model = OnlineCountVectorizer(stop_words=\"english\", decay=.01)\n\ntopic_model = BERTopic(umap_model=umap_model,\n                       hdbscan_model=cluster_model,\n                       vectorizer_model=vectorizer_model)\n\n# Incrementally fit the topic model by training on 1000 documents at a time\nfor docs in doc_chunks:\n    topic_model.partial_fit(docs)\n</code></pre> <p>Only the topics for the most recent batch of documents are tracked.

BERTopic works in two ways: </p> <p>First, we create embeddings for each seeded topics by joining them and passing them through the document embedder.  These embeddings will be compared with the existing document embeddings through cosine similarity and assigned a label.  If the document is most similar to a seeded topic, then it will get that topic's label.  If it is most similar to the average document embedding, it will get the -1 label.  These labels are then passed through UMAP to create a semi-supervised approach that should nudge the topic creation to the seeded topics. </p> <p>Second, we take all words in <code>seed_topic_list</code> and assign them a multiplier larger than 1.  Those multipliers will be used to increase the IDF values of the words across all topics thereby increasing  the likelihood that a seeded topic word will appear in a topic. This does, however, also increase the chance of an  irrelevant topic having unrelated words. In practice, this should not be an issue since the IDF value is likely to  remain low regardless of the multiplier. The multiplier is now a fixed value but may change to something more elegant,  like taking the distribution of IDF values and its position into account when defining the multiplier. </p> <pre><code>seed_topic_list = [[\"company\", \"billion\", \"quarter\", \"shrs\", \"earnings\"],\n                   [\"acquisition\", \"procurement\", \"merge\"],\n                   [\"exchange\", \"currency\", \"trading\", \"rate\", \"euro\"],\n                   [\"grain\", \"wheat\", \"corn\"],\n                   [\"coffee\", \"cocoa\"],\n                   [\"natural\", \"gas\", \"oil\", \"fuel\", \"products\", \"petrol\"]]\n\ntopic_model = BERTopic(seed_topic_list=seed_topic_list)\ntopics, probs = topic_model.fit_transform(docs)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"changelog.html#version-081","title":"Version 0.8.1","text":"<p>Release date:  8 June, 2021</p> <p>Highlights:  </p> <ul> <li>Improved models:<ul> <li>For English documents the default is now: <code>\"paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2\"</code> </li> <li>For Non-English or multi-lingual documents the default is now: <code>\"paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2\"</code> </li> <li>Both models show not only great performance but are much faster!  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Add interactive visualizations to the <code>plotting</code> API documentation</li> </ul> <p>For better performance, please use the following models:  </p> <ul> <li>English: <code>\"paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2\"</code></li> <li>Non-English or multi-lingual: <code>\"paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2\"</code></li> </ul> <p>Fixes:   </p> <ul> <li>Improved unit testing for more stability</li> <li>Set transformers version for Flair</li> </ul>"},{"location":"changelog.html#version-080","title":"Version 0.8.0","text":"<p>Release date:  31 May, 2021</p> <p>Highlights:  </p> <ul> <li>Additional visualizations:<ul> <li>Topic Hierarchy: <code>topic_model.visualize_hierarchy()</code> </li> <li>Topic Similarity Heatmap: <code>topic_model.visualize_heatmap()</code> </li> <li>Topic Representation Barchart: <code>topic_model.visualize_barchart()</code> </li> <li>Term Score Decline: <code>topic_model.visualize_term_rank()</code> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Created <code>bertopic.plotting</code> library to easily extend visualizations</li> <li>Improved automatic topic reduction by using HDBSCAN to detect similar topics</li> <li>Sort topic ids by their frequency. -1 is the outlier class and contains typically the most documents.

This value is automatically set to the  same value of <code>min_cluster_size</code>. However, you can set it independently if you want to reduce the number of generated outliers. Lowering this value will  result in less noise being generated. </p> <pre><code>from bertopic import BERTopic\nfrom hdbscan import HDBSCAN\n\nhdbscan_model = HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=10, metric='euclidean', \n                        cluster_selection_method='eom', prediction_data=True, min_samples=5)\ntopic_model = BERTopic(hdbscan_model=hdbscan_model)\ntopics, probs = topic_model.fit_transform(docs)\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>Although this will lower outliers found in the data, this might force outliers to be put into topics where they do not belong. So make  sure to strike a balance between keeping noise and reducing outliers. </p> <p>Second, after training our BERTopic model, we can assign outliers to topics by making use of the <code>.reduce_outliers</code> function in BERTopic. An advantage of using this approach is that there are four built in strategies one can choose for reducing outliers. Moreover, this technique allows the user to experiment with reducing outliers across a number of strategies and parameters without actually having to re-train the topic model each time. You can learn more about the <code>.reduce_outlier</code> function here. The following is a minimal example of how to use this function:</p> <pre><code>from bertopic import BERTopic\n\n# Train your BERTopic model\ntopic_model = BERTopic()\ntopics, probs = topic_model.fit_transform(docs)\n\n# Reduce outliers\nnew_topics = topic_model.reduce_outliers(docs, topics)\n</code></pre> <p>Third, we can replace HDBSCAN with any other clustering algorithm that we want. So we can choose a clustering algorithm, like k-Means, that  does not produce any outliers at all. Using k-Means instead of HDBSCAN is straightforward:</p> <pre><code>from bertopic import BERTopic\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\ncluster_model = KMeans(n_clusters=50)\ntopic_model = BERTopic(hdbscan_model=cluster_model)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"faq.html#how-do-i-remove-stop-words","title":"How do I remove stop words?","text":"<p>At times, stop words might end up in our topic representations. This is something we typically want to avoid as they contribute little to the interpretation of the topics. However, removing stop words as a preprocessing step is not advised as the transformer-based embedding models that we use need the full context to create accurate embeddings. </p> <p>Instead, we can use the <code>CountVectorizer</code> to preprocess our documents after having generated embeddings and clustered  our documents.

These complications often result in infrequent releases of IPC classifications and projections, making it difficult to effectively respond to food insecurity in these areas.     One large source of daily-updated information is local news. Thus, one can build a model that classifies/predicts IPC by relying on news features obtained by NLP methods in addition to stuff like weather data. Previous research shows this is possible (see https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.15602.pdf). The authors find words related to food insecurity using semantic frame parsing. After which, they count the occurrence of these words to create features. The features are put into a linear classifier. We wanted to apply more advanced methods and use local news sources (which we suppose contain more localized information). We used BERTopic on over a million articles scraped from Somali news websites. Because articles are both in English and Somali, we use a multilingual sentence encoder (LaBSE, which outperforms newer models in Somali). The results are quite nice. For example, topics most strongly correlated with known conflict casualty data are topics about terrorist attacks, car bombings, etc. And topics most negatively correlated with known conflict casualty data are about peace talks. We can also get an indication of food price development and forced migration. Most importantly, we can track the development of topics relating to food insecurity over time. While topic modelling cannot replace evidence-based food insecurity assessment, it can give a quick insight into a local situation when 'hard data' is lacking.     I applaud you on your success with BERTopic. The package is incredibly clean and easy to use, and the method works well with little parameter tuning. To me, the fact that you were able to deliver such a useful tool on your own is incredible, especially in the field of NLP, which is dominated by large organizations such as google and meta.  \"     \u2022\u2022\u2022Cascha van WanrooijPhD StudentTilburg University </p></p>"},{"location":"usecases.html#papers","title":"Papers","text":"<p>BERTopic has also been adopted more and more in the academic field.

This means that a centroid-based topic representation technique might not be the best-fitting model. In other words, we want a topic representation technique that makes little to no assumption on the expected structure of the clusters.   To do this, we first combine all documents in a cluster into a single document. That, very long, document then represents the cluster. Then, we can count how often each word appears in each cluster. This generates something called a bag-of-words representation in which the frequency of each word in each cluster can be found. This bag-of-words representation is therefore on a cluster level and not on a document level. This distinction is important as we are interested in words on a topic level (i.e., cluster level).

Topic representation","text":"<p>From the generated bag-of-words representation, we want to know what makes one cluster different from another. Which words are typical for cluster 1 and not so much for all other clusters? To solve this, we need to modify TF-IDF such that it considers topics (i.e., clusters) instead of documents.    When you apply TF-IDF as usual on a set of documents, what you are doing is comparing the importance of  words between documents. Now, what if, we instead treat all documents in a single category (e.g., a cluster) as a single document and then apply TF-IDF? The result would be importance scores for words within a cluster. The more important words are within a cluster, the more it is representative of that topic. In other words, if we extract the most important words per cluster, we get descriptions of topics! This model is called class-based TF-IDF: </p> <p></p> <p> Each cluster is converted to a single document instead of a set of documents. Then, we extract the frequency of word <code>x</code> in class <code>c</code>, where <code>c</code> refers to the cluster we created before. This results in our class-based <code>tf</code> representation. This representation is L1-normalized to account for the differences in topic sizes.     Then, we take the logarithm of one plus the average number of words per class <code>A</code> divided by the frequency of word <code>x</code> across all classes. We add plus one within the logarithm to force values to be positive. This results in our class-based <code>idf</code> representation. Like with the classic TF-IDF, we then multiply <code>tf</code> with <code>idf</code> to get the importance score per word in each class. In other words, the classical TF-IDF procedure is not used here but a modified version of the algorithm that allows for a much better representation. </p> <p>Tip</p> <p>In the <code>ClassTfidfTransformer</code>, there are a few parameters that might be worth exploring, including an option to perform additional BM-25 weighting.

Then, a\n        sliding window is applied on each document creating subsets of the document.\n        For example, with a window size of 3 and stride of 1, the sentence:\n\n        `Solving the right problem is difficult.`\n\n        can be split up into `solving the right`, `the right problem`, `right problem is`,\n        and `problem is difficult`. These are called tokensets. For each of these\n        tokensets, we calculate their c-TF-IDF representation and find out\n        how similar they are to the previously generated topics.

Then, a\n    sliding window is applied on each document creating subsets of the document.\n    For example, with a window size of 3 and stride of 1, the sentence:\n\n    `Solving the right problem is difficult.`\n\n    can be split up into `solving the right`, `the right problem`, `right problem is`,\n    and `problem is difficult`. These are called tokensets. For each of these\n    tokensets, we calculate their c-TF-IDF representation and find out\n    how similar they are to the previously generated topics. Then, the\n    similarities to the topics for each tokenset are summed in order to\n    create a topic distribution for the entire document.\n\n    We can also dive into this a bit deeper by then splitting these tokensets\n    up into individual tokens and calculate how much a word, in a specific sentence,\n    contributes to the topics found in that document. This can be enabled by\n    setting `calculate_tokens=True` which can be used for visualization purposes\n    in `topic_model.visualize_approximate_distribution`.\n\n    The main output, `topic_distributions`, can also be used directly in\n    `.visualize_distribution(topic_distributions[index])` by simply selecting\n    a single distribution.\n\n    Arguments:\n        documents: A single document or a list of documents for which we\n                approximate their topic distributions\n        window: Size of the moving window which indicates the number of\n                tokens being considered.\n        stride: How far the window should move at each step.\n        min_similarity: The minimum similarity of a document's tokenset\n                        with respect to the topics.\n        batch_size: The number of documents to process at a time. If None,\n                    then all documents are processed at once.\n                    NOTE: With a large number of documents, it is not\n                    advised to process all documents at once.\n        padding: Whether to pad the beginning and ending of a document with\n                 empty tokens.\n        use_embedding_model: Whether to use the topic model's embedding\n                            model to calculate the similarity between\n                            tokensets and topics instead of using c-TF-IDF.\n        calculate_tokens: Calculate the similarity of tokens with all topics.\n                        NOTE: This is computation-wise more expensive and\n                        can require more memory.

These techniques allow the user to set a predefined number of topic representations that are sure to be in documents. For example, take an IT business that has a ticket system for the software their clients use. Those tickets may typically contain information about a specific bug regarding login issues that the IT business is aware of.  </p> <p>To model that bug, we can create a seed topic representation containing the words <code>bug</code>, <code>login</code>, <code>password</code>,  and <code>username</code>. By defining those words, a Guided Topic Modeling approach will try to converge at least one topic to those words.</p> <p></p> \"drug cancer drugs doctor\"  \"windows drive dos file\"  \"space launch orbit lunar\"  Concatenate and embed the keywords/keyphrases using the embedding model.

These embeddings will be compared with the existing document embeddings through cosine similarity and assigned a label. If the document is most similar to a seeded topic, then it will get that topic's label.  If it is most similar to the average document embedding, it will get the -1 label.  These labels are then passed through UMAP to create a semi-supervised approach that should nudge  the topic creation to the seeded topics.</p> <p>Second, we take all words in seed_topic_list and assign them a multiplier larger than 1.  Those multipliers will be used to increase the IDF values of the words across all topics thereby increasing  the likelihood that a seeded topic word will appear in a topic. This does, however, also increase the chance of an irrelevant topic having unrelated words. In practice, this should not be an issue since the IDF value is likely to remain low regardless of the multiplier. The multiplier is now a fixed value but may change to something more elegant, like taking the distribution of IDF values and its position into account when defining the multiplier.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started/guided/guided.html#example","title":"Example","text":"<p>To demonstrate Guided BERTopic, we use the 20 Newsgroups dataset as our example.

Essentially, it is a way to update your topic model with data on which it was not trained before. In Scikit-Learn, this technique is often modeled through a <code>.partial_fit</code> function, which is also used in BERTopic. </p> <p>In BERTopic, there are three main goals for using this technique.</p> <ul> <li>To reduce the memory necessary for training a topic model. </li> <li>To continuously update the topic model as new data comes in. </li> <li>To continuously find new topics as new data comes in. </li> </ul> <p>In BERTopic, online topic modeling can be a bit tricky as there are several steps involved in which online learning needs to be made available. To recap, BERTopic consists of the following 6 steps:</p> <ol> <li>Extract embeddings</li> <li>Reduce dimensionality</li> <li>Cluster reduced embeddings</li> <li>Tokenize topics</li> <li>Extract topic words</li> <li>Diversify topic words</li> </ol> <p>For some steps, an online variant is more important than others. Typically, in step 1 we use pre-trained language models that are in less need of continuous updates. This means that we can use an embedding model like Sentence-Transformers for extracting the embeddings and still use it in an online setting. Similarly, steps 5 and 6 do not necessarily need online variants since they are built upon step 4, tokenization. If that tokenization is by itself incremental, then so will steps 5 and 6. </p> <p></p> SBERT IncrementalPCA  MiniBatchKMeans  Online CountVectorizer Embeddings Dimensionality  reduction Clustering Incremental  Bag-of-Words c-TF-IDF Topic  representation Online variants of these steps in the main BERTopic pipeline  are needed in order to enable incremental learning.  <p></p> <p>This means that we will need online variants for steps 2 through 4. Steps 2 and 3, dimensionality reduction and clustering, can be modeled through the use of Scikit-Learn's <code>.partial_fit</code> function. In other words, it supports any algorithm that can be trained using <code>.partial_fit</code> since these algorithms can be trained incrementally. For example, incremental dimensionality reduction can be achieved using Scikit-Learn's <code>IncrementalPCA</code> and incremental clustering with <code>MiniBatchKMeans</code>.</p> <p>Lastly, we need to develop an online variant for step 5, tokenization. In this step, a Bag-of-words representation is created through the <code>CountVectorizer</code>. However, as new data comes in, its vocabulary will need to be updated. For that purpose, <code>bertopic.vectorizers.OnlineCountVectorizer</code> was created that not only updates out-of-vocabulary words but also implements decay and cleaning functions to prevent the sparse bag-of-words matrix to become too large. Most notably, the <code>decay</code> parameter is a value between 0 and 1 to weigh the percentage of frequencies that the previous bag-of-words matrix should be reduced to. For example, a value of <code>.1</code> will decrease the frequencies in the bag-of-words matrix by 10% at each iteration. This will make sure that recent data has more weight than previous iterations. Similarly, <code>delete_min_df</code> will remove certain words from its vocabulary if their frequency is lower than a set value. This ties together with the <code>decay</code> parameter as some words will decay over time if not used.

To prevent a huge vocabulary, we can set the <code>min_df</code> to only accept  words that have a minimum frequency. </p> <p>When you have millions of documents or error issues, I would advise increasing the value of <code>min_df</code> as long as the topic representations might sense:</p> <pre><code>from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nvectorizer_model = CountVectorizer(min_df=10)\ntopic_model.update_topics(docs, vectorizer_model=vectorizer_model)\n</code></pre> <p>With the following topic representation:</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; topic_model.get_topic_info()[1:11]\n    Topic   Count   Name\n1   0   1822    0_game_team_games_he\n2   1   580 1_key_clipper_chip_encryption\n3   2   532 2_hello_hi_yep_huh\n4   3   493 3_israel_jews_jewish_peace\n5   4   453 4_card_monitor_video_drivers\n6   5   438 5_you_your_post_jim\n7   6   314 6_car_cars_engine_ford\n8   7   279 7_health_newsgroup_cancer_1993\n9   8   218 8_fbi_koresh_fire_gas\n10  9   174 9_audio_condition_stereo_asking\n</code></pre> <p>As you can see, the output is nearly the same which is what we would like to achieve.

Therefore, a <code>decay</code> parameter was implemented that decays the bag-of-words' frequencies at each iteration before adding the document frequencies of new documents. The <code>decay</code> parameter is a value between 0 and 1 and indicates the percentage of frequencies the previous bag-of-words matrix should be reduced to. For example, a value of <code>.1</code> will decrease the frequencies in the bag-of-words matrix by 10% at each iteration before adding the new bag-of-words matrix.

For these reasons, the <code>delete_min_df</code> parameter was implemented. The parameter takes positive integers and indicates, at each iteration, which words will be removed. If the value is set to 5, it will check after each iteration if the total frequency of a word is exceeded by that value. If so, the word will be removed in its entirety from the bag-of-words matrix.

At some point adding words to the topic representation only marginally  increases the total c-TF-IDF score and would not be beneficial for its representation. </p> <p>To visualize this effect, we can plot the c-TF-IDF scores for each topic by the term rank of each word.  In other words, the position of the words (term rank), where the words with  the highest c-TF-IDF score will have a rank of 1, will be put on the x-axis. Whereas the y-axis  will be populated by the c-TF-IDF scores. The result is a visualization that shows you the decline  of c-TF-IDF score when adding words to the topic representation.

def truncate_document(topic_model, doc_length, tokenizer, document: str):
    """Truncate a document to a certain length.

    If you want to add a custom tokenizer, then it will need to have a `decode` and
    `encode` method. An example would be the following custom tokenizer:

    ```python
    class Tokenizer:
        'A custom tokenizer that splits on commas'
        def encode(self, doc):
            return doc.split(",")

        def decode(self, doc_chunks):
            return ",".join(doc_chunks)
    ```

    You can use this tokenizer by passing it to the `tokenizer` parameter.

    Arguments:
        topic_model: A BERTopic model
        doc_length: The maximum length of each document. If a document is longer,
                    it will be truncated. If None, the entire document is passed.
        tokenizer: The tokenizer used to calculate to split the document into segments
                   used to count the length of a document.
                       * If tokenizer is 'char', then the document is split up
                         into characters which are counted to adhere to `doc_length`
                       * If tokenizer is 'whitespace', the document is split up
                         into words separated by whitespaces. These words are counted
                         and truncated depending on `doc_length`
                       * If tokenizer is 'vectorizer', then the internal CountVectorizer
                         is used to tokenize the document. These tokens are counted
                         and truncated depending on `doc_length`. They are decoded with
                         whitespaces.
                       * If tokenizer is a callable, then that callable is used to tokenize
                         the document. These tokens are counted and truncated depending
                         on `doc_length`
        document: A single document

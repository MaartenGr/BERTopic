class BERTopic:
    """BERTopic is a topic modeling technique that leverages BERT embeddings and
    c-TF-IDF to create dense clusters allowing for easily interpretable topics
    whilst keeping important words in the topic descriptions.

    Usage:

    ```python
    from bertopic import BERTopic
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups

    docs = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all')['data']
    topic_model = BERTopic()
    topics, probabilities = topic_model.fit_transform(docs)
    ```

    If you want to use your own embedding model, use it as follows:

    ```python
    from bertopic import BERTopic
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

    docs = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all')['data']
    sentence_model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
    topic_model = BERTopic(embedding_model=sentence_model)
    ```

    Due to the stochastisch nature of UMAP, the results from BERTopic might differ
    and the quality can degrade. Using your own embeddings allows you to
    try out BERTopic several times until you find the topics that suit
    you best.

        Arguments:
            language: The main language used in your documents. For a full overview of
                      supported languages see bertopic.backend.languages. Select
                      "multilingual" to load in a sentence-tranformers model that supports 50+ languages.
            top_n_words: The number of words per topic to extract. Setting this
                         too high can negatively impact topic embeddings as topics
                         are typically best represented by at most 10 words.
            n_gram_range: The n-gram range for the CountVectorizer.
                          Advised to keep high values between 1 and 3.
                          More would likely lead to memory issues.
                          NOTE: This param will not be used if you pass in your own
                          CountVectorizer.
            min_topic_size: The minimum size of the topic. Increasing this value will lead
                            to a lower number of clusters/topics.
            nr_topics: Specifying the number of topics will reduce the initial
                       number of topics to the value specified. This reduction can take
                       a while as each reduction in topics (-1) activates a c-TF-IDF
                       calculation. If this is set to None, no reduction is applied. Use
                       "auto" to automatically reduce topics using HDBSCAN.
            low_memory: Sets UMAP low memory to True to make sure less memory is used.
                        NOTE: This is only used in UMAP. For example, if you use PCA instead of UMAP
                        this parameter will not be used.
            calculate_probabilities: Whether to calculate the probabilities of all topics
                                     per document instead of the probability of the assigned
                                     topic per document. This could slow down the extraction
                                     of topics if you have many documents (> 100_000). Set this
                                     only to True if you have a low amount of documents or if
                                     you do not mind more computation time.
                                     NOTE: If false you cannot use the corresponding
                                     visualization method `visualize_probabilities`.
            diversity: Whether to use MMR to diversify the resulting topic representations.
                       If set to None, MMR will not be used. Accepted values lie between
                       0 and 1 with 0 being not at all diverse and 1 being very diverse.
            seed_topic_list: A list of seed words per topic to converge around
            verbose: Changes the verbosity of the model, Set to True if you want
                     to track the stages of the model.
            embedding_model: Use a custom embedding model.

        """ Create topics over time

        To create the topics over time, BERTopic needs to be already fitted once.
        From the fitted models, the c-TF-IDF representations are calculate at
        each timestamp t. Then, the c-TF-IDF representations at timestamp t are
        averaged with the global c-TF-IDF representations in order to fine-tune the
        local representations.

        NOTE:
            Make sure to use a limited number of unique timestamps (<100) as the
            c-TF-IDF representation will be calculated at each single unique timestamp.
            Having a large number of unique timestamps can take some time to be calculated.
            Moreover, there aren't many use-cased where you would like to see the difference
            in topic representations over more than 100 different timestamps.

        Arguments:
            docs: The documents you used when calling either `fit` or `fit_transform`
            topics: The topics that were returned when calling either `fit` or `fit_transform`
            timestamps: The timestamp of each document. This can be either a list of strings or ints.
                        If it is a list of strings, then the datetime format will be automatically
                        inferred. If it is a list of ints, then the documents will be ordered by
                        ascending order.
            nr_bins: The number of bins you want to create for the timestamps. The left interval will
                     be chosen as the timestamp. An additional column will be created with the
                     entire interval.
            datetime_format: The datetime format of the timestamps if they are strings, eg “%d/%m/%Y”.
                             Set this to None if you want to have it automatically detect the format.
                             See strftime documentation for more information on choices:
                             https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior.
            evolution_tuning: Fine-tune each topic representation at timestamp t by averaging its
                              c-TF-IDF matrix with the c-TF-IDF matrix at timestamp t-1. This creates
                              evolutionary topic representations.
            global_tuning: Fine-tune each topic representation at timestamp t by averaging its c-TF-IDF matrix
                       with the global c-TF-IDF matrix. Turn this off if you want to prevent words in
                       topic representations that could not be found in the documents at timestamp t.

                              at timestamp t.

        Usage:

        The timestamps variable represent the timestamp of each document. If you have over
        100 unique timestamps, it is advised to bin the timestamps as shown below:

Over the last few years, BERTopic has been used on a wide variety of use cases and domains, from cancer research and voice perception, to employee surveys and social media. This diversity allows for interesting use cases but it might quickly become overwhelming. This page is meant to demonstrate how, when, and why BERTopic is used in practice.

It follows the principles of IFOTES (International Federation Of Telephone Emergency Services). The regional offices each offer independent counseling services via telephone or online.<br><br>
        The phone call memos are written by hundreds of independent volunteers and come in various shapes, lengths, forms, and wordings - additionally to have them in multiple languages. While using BERTopic we ran a few tests to figure out if the topic modeling works. Selecting only one language with ~60K data points and a mixed language model we achieved good results. It helped identify topics within the calls and therefore show the organization what reasons there are for people calling them. We identified in a workshop a few interesting topics, which they were not aware of, for example, religious topics.<br><br>
        The identification of existing and new, arising topics is crucial for the service quality of the organization. It furthermore helps detect trends over time, which can then be reported directly to Public Health institutions, which can then come up with campaigns to inform the public and help reduce certain psychological concerns. It acts as a representative psychological health barometer of the population."</i><br>

#### Zero Hunger Lab

        <i>"I am a PhD student at Tilburg University, at a lab called Zero Hunger Lab, where we try to use data science methods to improve food insecurity. One key issue is classifying and predicting food insecurity in food-insecure nations. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system serves this purpose. The IPC categorizes food insecurity into five phases, ranging from minimal food insecurity to famine, and serves as a guide for directing humanitarian resources to the most affected regions.<br><br>
        The IPC system strives to be based on evidence, however, obtaining accurate information about food insecurity in remote regions can prove challenging. Despite the availability of weather data, data in the socio-economic domain, such as food prices and conflict, can be scarce or unreliable due to limited infrastructure and bureaucratic obstacles. These complications often result in infrequent releases of IPC classifications and projections, making it difficult to effectively respond to food insecurity in these areas.<br><br>
        One large source of daily-updated information is local news. Thus, one can build a model that classifies/predicts IPC by relying on news features obtained by NLP methods in addition to stuff like weather data. Previous research shows this is possible (see https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.15602.pdf). The authors find words related to food insecurity using semantic frame parsing. After which, they count the occurrence of these words to create features. The features are put into a linear classifier. We wanted to apply more advanced methods and use local news sources (which we suppose contain more localized information). We used BERTopic on over a million articles scraped from Somali news websites. Because articles are both in English and Somali, we use a multilingual sentence encoder (LaBSE, which outperforms newer models in Somali). The results are quite nice. For example, topics most strongly correlated with known conflict casualty data are topics about terrorist attacks, car bombings, etc. And topics most negatively correlated with known conflict casualty data are about peace talks. We can also get an indication of food price development and forced migration. Most importantly, we can track the development of topics relating to food insecurity over time. While topic modelling cannot replace evidence-based food insecurity assessment, it can give a quick insight into a local situation when 'hard data' is lacking.<br><br>
        I applaud you on your success with BERTopic. The package is incredibly clean and easy to use, and the method works well with little parameter tuning. To me, the fact that you were able to deliver such a useful tool on your own is incredible, especially in the field of NLP, which is dominated by large organizations such as google and meta.

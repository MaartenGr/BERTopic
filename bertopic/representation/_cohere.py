This is a list of texts where each collection of texts describe a topic. After each collection of texts, the name of the topic they represent is mentioned as a short-highly-descriptive title

Topic:
Sample texts from this topic:
- Traditional diets in most cultures were primarily plant-based with a little meat on top, but with the rise of industrial style meat production and factory farming, meat has become a staple food.
- Meat, but especially beef, is the word food in terms of emissions.
- Eating meat doesn't make you a bad person, not eating meat doesn't make you a good one.

class Cohere(BaseRepresentation):
    """ Use the Cohere API to generate topic labels based on their
    generative model.

    Find more about their models here:
    https://docs.cohere.ai/docs

    Arguments:
        client: A cohere.Client
        model: Model to use within Cohere, defaults to `"xlarge"`.
        prompt: The prompt to be used in the model. If no prompt is given,
                `self.default_prompt_` is used instead.
                NOTE: Use `"[KEYWORDS]"` and `"[DOCUMENTS]"` in the prompt
                to decide where the keywords and documents need to be
                inserted.
        delay_in_seconds: The delay in seconds between consecutive prompts 
                                in order to prevent RateLimitErrors. 
        nr_docs: The number of documents to pass to OpenAI if a prompt
                 with the `["DOCUMENTS"]` tag is used.
        diversity: The diversity of documents to pass to OpenAI.
                   Accepts values between 0 and 1. A higher 
                   values results in passing more diverse documents
                   whereas lower values passes more similar documents.
        doc_length: The maximum length of each document. If a document is longer,
                    it will be truncated. If None, the entire document is passed.
        tokenizer: The tokenizer used to calculate to split the document into segments
                   used to count the length of a document. 
                       * If tokenizer is 'char', then the document is split up 
                         into characters which are counted to adhere to `doc_length`
                       * If tokenizer is 'whitespace', the document is split up
                         into words separated by whitespaces. These words are counted
                         and truncated depending on `doc_length`
                       * If tokenizer is 'vectorizer', then the internal CountVectorizer
                         is used to tokenize the document. These tokens are counted
                         and trunctated depending on `doc_length`
                       * If tokenizer is a callable, then that callable is used to tokenize
                         the document. These tokens are counted and truncated depending
                         on `doc_length`

    Usage:

    To use this, you will need to install cohere first:

    `pip install cohere`

    Then, get yourself an API key and use Cohere's API as follows:

    ```python
    import cohere
    from bertopic.representation import Cohere
    from bertopic import BERTopic

    # Create your representation model
    co = cohere.Client(my_api_key)
    representation_model = Cohere(co)

    # Use the representation model in BERTopic on top of the default pipeline
    topic_model = BERTopic(representation_model=representation_model)
    ```

    You can also use a custom prompt:

    ```python
    prompt = "I have the following documents: [DOCUMENTS]. What topic do they contain?"
    representation_model = Cohere(co, prompt=prompt)
    ```

    A Class-based TF-IDF procedure using scikit-learns TfidfTransformer as a base.

    ![](../img/ctfidf.png)

    C-TF-IDF can best be explained as a TF-IDF formula adopted for multiple classes
    by joining all documents per class. Thus, each class is converted to a single document
    instead of set of documents. Then, the frequency of words **t** are extracted for
    each class **i** and divided by the total number of words **w**.
    Next, the total, unjoined, number of documents across all classes **m** is divided by the total
    sum of word **i** across all classes.

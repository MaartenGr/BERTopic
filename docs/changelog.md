<h3><b><a href="https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/algorithm/algorithm.html">Documentation</a></b></h3>

Personally, I believe that documentation can be seen as a feature and is an often underestimated aspect of open-source. So I went a bit overboardðŸ˜…... and created an animation about the three pillars of BERTopic using Manim. There are many other visualizations added, one of each variation of BERTopic, and many smaller changes. 

<iframe width="1200" height="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25746895/205490350-cd9833e7-9cd5-44fa-8752-407d748de633.mp4

<h3><b><a href="https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/distribution/distribution.html">Topic Distributions</a></b></h3>

The difficulty with a cluster-based topic modeling technique is that it does not directly consider that documents may contain multiple topics. With the new release, we can now model the distributions of topics! We even consider that a single word might be related to multiple topics. If a document is a mixture of topics, what is preventing a single word to be the same? 

To do so, we approximate the distribution of topics in a document by calculating and summing the similarities of tokensets (achieved by applying a sliding window) with the topics:

```python
# After fitting your model run the following for either your trained documents or even unseen documents
topic_distr, _ = topic_model.approximate_distribution(docs)
```

To calculate and visualize the topic distributions in a document on a token-level, we can run the following:

```python
# We need to calculate the topic distributions on a token level
topic_distr, topic_token_distr = topic_model.approximate_distribution(docs, calculate_tokens=True)

# Create a visualization using a styled dataframe if Jinja2 is installed
df = topic_model.visualize_approximate_distribution(docs[0], topic_token_distr[0]); df
```

<h3><b><a href="https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/supervised/supervised.html">Supervised Topic Modeling</a></b></h3>

BERTopic now supports fully-supervised classification! Instead of using a clustering algorithm, like HDBSCAN, we can replace it with a classifier, like Logistic Regression:

```python
from bertopic import BERTopic
from bertopic.dimensionality import BaseDimensionalityReduction
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Get labeled data
data= fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all',  remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes'))
docs = data['data']
y = data['target']

# Allows us to skip over the dimensionality reduction step
empty_dimensionality_model = BaseDimensionalityReduction()

# Create a classifier to be used instead of the cluster model
clf= LogisticRegression()

# Create a fully supervised BERTopic instance
topic_model= BERTopic(
        umap_model=empty_dimensionality_model,
        hdbscan_model=clf
)
topics, probs = topic_model.fit_transform(docs, y=y)
```

<h3><b><a href="https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/manual/manual.html">Manual Topic Modeling</a></b></h3>

When you already have a bunch of labels and simply want to extract topic representations from them, you might not need to actually learn how those can predicted. We can bypass the `embeddings -> dimensionality reduction -> clustering` steps and go straight to the c-TF-IDF representation of our labels:

```python
from bertopic import BERTopic
from bertopic.backend import BaseEmbedder
from bertopic.cluster import BaseCluster
from bertopic.dimensionality import BaseDimensionalityReduction

# Prepare our empty sub-models and reduce frequent words while we are at it.
empty_embedding_model = BaseEmbedder()
empty_dimensionality_model = BaseDimensionalityReduction()
empty_cluster_model = BaseCluster()

# Fit BERTopic without actually performing any clustering
topic_model= BERTopic(
        embedding_model=empty_embedding_model,
        umap_model=empty_dimensionality_model,
        hdbscan_model=empty_cluster_model,
)
topics, probs = topic_model.fit_transform(docs, y=y)
```

<h3><b><a href="https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/outlier_reduction/outlier_reduction.html">Outlier Reduction</a></b></h3>

Outlier reduction is an frequently-discussed topic in BERTopic as its default cluster model, HDBSCAN, has a tendency to generate many outliers. This often helps in the topic representation steps, as we do not consider documents that are less relevant, but you might want to still assign those outliers to actual topics. In the modular philosophy of BERTopic, keeping training times in mind, it is now possible to perform outlier reduction **after** having trained your topic model. This allows for ease of iteration and prevents having to train BERTopic many times to find the parameters you are searching for. There are 4 different strategies that you can use, so make sure to check out the [documentation](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/outlier_reduction/outlier_reduction.html)!

Using it is rather straightforward:

```python
new_topics = topic_model.reduce_outliers(docs, topics)
```

<h3><b><a href="https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/tips_and_tricks/tips_and_tricks.html#lightweight-installation">Lightweight BERTopic</a></b></h3>

The default embedding model in BERTopic is one of the amazing sentence-transformers models, namely `"all-MiniLM-L6-v2"`. Although this model performs well out of the box, it typically needs a GPU to transform the documents into embeddings in a reasonable time. Moreover, the installation requires `pytorch` which often results in a rather large environment, memory-wise. 

Fortunately, it is possible to install BERTopic without `sentence-transformers` and use it as a lightweight solution instead. The installation can be done as follows:

```bash
pip install --no-deps bertopic
pip install --upgrade numpy hdbscan umap-learn pandas scikit-learn tqdm plotly pyyaml
```

Then, we can use BERTopic without `sentence-transformers` as follows using a CPU-based embedding technique:

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

pipe = make_pipeline(
    TfidfVectorizer(),
    TruncatedSVD(100)
)

topic_model = BERTopic(embedding_model=pipe)
```

As a result, the entire package and resulting model can be run quickly on the CPU and no GPU is necessary!

<h3><b><a href="https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/api/bertopic.html#bertopic._bertopic.BERTopic.get_document_info">Document Information</a></b></h3>

Get information about the documents on which the topic was trained including the documents themselves, their respective topics, the name of each topic, the top n words of each topic, whether it is a representative document, and the probability of the clustering if the cluster model supports it. There are also options to include other metadata, such as the topic distributions or the x and y coordinates of the reduced embeddings that you can learn more about <a href="https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/api/bertopic.html#bertopic._bertopic.BERTopic.get_document_info">here</a>.

To get the document info, you will only need to pass the documents on which the topic model was trained:


```python
>>> topic_model.get_document_info(docs)

Document                               Topic	Name	                    Top_n_words                     Probability    ...

**Online/incremental topic modeling**:

Online topic modeling (sometimes called "incremental topic modeling") is the ability to learn incrementally from a mini-batch of instances. Essentially, it is a way to update your topic model with data on which it was not trained on before. In Scikit-Learn, this technique is often modeled through a `.partial_fit` function, which is also used in BERTopic. 

At a minimum, the cluster model needs to support a `.partial_fit` function in order to use this feature. The default HDBSCAN model will not work as it does not support online updating. 

```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
from sklearn.cluster import MiniBatchKMeans
from sklearn.decomposition import IncrementalPCA
from bertopic.vectorizers import OnlineCountVectorizer
from bertopic import BERTopic

# Prepare documents
all_docs = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=subset,  remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes'))["data"]
doc_chunks = [all_docs[i:i+1000] for i in range(0, len(all_docs), 1000)]

# Prepare sub-models that support online learning
umap_model = IncrementalPCA(n_components=5)
cluster_model = MiniBatchKMeans(n_clusters=50, random_state=0)
vectorizer_model = OnlineCountVectorizer(stop_words="english", decay=.01)

topic_model = BERTopic(umap_model=umap_model,
                       hdbscan_model=cluster_model,
                       vectorizer_model=vectorizer_model)

# Incrementally fit the topic model by training on 1000 documents at a time
for docs in doc_chunks:
    topic_model.partial_fit(docs)
```

Only the topics for the most recent batch of documents are tracked. If you want to be using online topic modeling, not for a streaming setting but merely for low-memory use cases, then it is advised to also update the `.topics_` attribute as variations such as hierarchical topic modeling will not work afterward:

```python
# Incrementally fit the topic model by training on 1000 documents at a time and track the topics in each iteration
topics = []
for docs in doc_chunks:
    topic_model.partial_fit(docs)
    topics.extend(topic_model.topics_)

topic_model.topics_ = topics
```

**c-TF-IDF**:

Explicitly define, use, and adjust the `ClassTfidfTransformer` with new parameters, `bm25_weighting` and `reduce_frequent_words`, to potentially improve the topic representation: 

```python
from bertopic import BERTopic
from bertopic.vectorizers import ClassTfidfTransformer

ctfidf_model = ClassTfidfTransformer(bm25_weighting=True)
topic_model = BERTopic(ctfidf_model=ctfidf_model)
```

**Attributes**:

After having fitted your BERTopic instance, you can use the following attributes to have quick access to certain information, such as the topic assignment for each document in `topic_model.topics_`. 

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|--------------------|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| topics_            | List[int]   | The topics that are generated for each document after training or updating the topic model. The most recent topics are tracked.  |
| probabilities_ | List[float] | The probability of the assigned topic per document. These are only calculated if a HDBSCAN model is used for the clustering step. When `calculate_probabilities=True`, then it is the probabilities of all topics per document. |
| topic_sizes_          | Mapping[int, int] | The size of each topic.                                                                   |
| topic_mapper_         | TopicMapper | A class for tracking topics and their mappings anytime they are merged, reduced, added, or removed.             |
| topic_representations_  | Mapping[int, Tuple[int, float]] | The top *n* terms per topic and their respective c-TF-IDF values.                            |
| c_tf_idf_             | csr_matrix | The topic-term matrix as calculated through c-TF-IDF. To access its respective words, run `.vectorizer_model.get_feature_names()` or `.vectorizer_model.get_feature_names_out()`                                      |
| topic_labels_         | Mapping[int, str] |  The default labels for each topic.                                                          |
| custom_labels_        | List[str] | Custom labels for each topic as generated through `.set_topic_labels`.                                                               |
| topic_embeddings_     | np.ndarray | The embeddings for each topic. It is calculated by taking the weighted average of word embeddings in a topic based on their c-TF-IDF values.                                                  |
| representative_docs_  | Mapping[int, str] | The representative documents for each topic if HDBSCAN is used.                                                |

## **Version 0.10.0**
*Release date: 30 April, 2022*


**Highlights**: 

* Use any dimensionality reduction technique instead of UMAP:

```python
from bertopic import BERTopic
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

dim_model = PCA(n_components=5)
topic_model = BERTopic(umap_model=dim_model)
```

* Use any clustering technique instead of HDBSCAN:

```python
from bertopic import BERTopic
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

cluster_model = KMeans(n_clusters=50)
topic_model = BERTopic(hdbscan_model=cluster_model)
```

**Documentation**: 

* Add a CountVectorizer page with tips and tricks on how to create topic representations that fit your use case
* Added pages on how to use other dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms
 * Additional instructions on how to reduce outliers in the FAQ:

```python 
import numpy as np
probability_threshold = 0.01
new_topics = [np.argmax(prob) if max(prob) >= probability_threshold else -1 for prob in probs] 
```

**Fixes**: 

* Fixed `None` being returned for probabilities when transforming unseen documents
* Replaced all instances of `arg:` with `Arguments:` for consistency
* Before saving a fitted BERTopic instance, we remove the stopwords in the fitted CountVectorizer model as it can get quite large due to the number of words that end in stopwords if `min_df` is set to a value larger than 1
* Set `"hdbscan>=0.8.28"` to prevent numpy issues
  * Although this was already fixed by the new release of HDBSCAN, it is technically still possible to install 0.8.27 with BERTopic which leads to these numpy issues
* Update gensim dependency to `>=4.0.0` ([#371](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/371))
* Fix topic 0 not appearing in visualizations ([#472](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/472))
* Fix ([#506](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/506))
* Fix ([#429](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/429))
* Fix typo in DTM documentation by [@hp0404](https://github.com/hp0404) in [#386](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/pull/386)

## **Version 0.9.4**
*Release date: 14 December, 2021*

A number of fixes, documentation updates, and small features:

* Expose diversity parameter
    * Use `BERTopic(diversity=0.1)` to change how diverse the words in a topic representation are (ranges from 0 to 1)
* Improve stability of topic reduction by only computing the cosine similarity within c-TF-IDF and not the topic embeddings
* Added property to c-TF-IDF that all IDF values should be positive ([#351](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/351))
* Improve stability of `.visualize_barchart()` and `.visualize_hierarchy()`
* Major [documentation](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/) overhaul (mkdocs, tutorials, FAQ, images, etc. ) ([#330](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/330))
* Drop python 3.6 ([#333](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/333))
* Relax plotly dependency ([#88](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/88))
* Additional logging for `.transform` ([#356](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/356))


## **Version 0.9.3**
*Release date:  17 October, 2021*

* Fix [#282](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/282)
    * As it turns out the old implementation of topic mapping was still found in the `transform` function
* Fix [#285](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/285)
    * Fix getting all representative docs
* Fix [#288](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/288)
    * A recent issue with the package `pyyaml` that can be found in Google Colab


## **Version 0.9.2**
*Release date:  12 October, 2021*

A release focused on algorithmic optimization and fixing several issues:

**Highlights**:  
  
* Update the non-multilingual paraphrase-* models to the all-* models due to improved [performance](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html)
* Reduce necessary RAM in c-TF-IDF top 30 word [extraction](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49207275/finding-the-top-n-values-in-a-row-of-a-scipy-sparse-matrix)

**Fixes**:  

* Fix topic mapping
    * When reducing the number of topics, these need to be mapped to the correct input/output which had some issues in the previous version
    * A new class was created as a way to track these mappings regardless of how many times they were executed
    * In other words, you can iteratively reduce the number of topics after training the model without the need to continuously train the model
* Fix typo in embeddings page ([#200](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/200)) 
* Fix link in README ([#233](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/233))
* Fix documentation `.visualize_term_rank()` ([#253](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/253)) 
* Fix getting correct representative docs ([#258](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/258))
* Update [memory FAQ](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/faq.html#i-am-facing-memory-issues-help) with [HDBSCAN pr](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/151)

## **Version 0.9.1**
*Release date:  1 September, 2021*

A release focused on fixing several issues:

**Fixes**:  

* Fix TypeError when auto-reducing topics ([#210](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/210)) 
* Fix mapping representative docs when reducing topics ([#208](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/208))
* Fix visualization issues with probabilities ([#205](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/205))
* Fix missing `normalize_frequency` param in plots ([#213](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/208))
  

## **Version 0.9.0**
*Release date:  9 August, 2021*

**Highlights**:  

* Implemented a [**Guided BERTopic**](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/guided/guided.html) -> Use seeds to steer the Topic Modeling
* Get the most representative documents per topic: `topic_model.get_representative_docs(topic=1)`
    * This allows users to see which documents are good representations of a topic and better understand the topics that were created
* Added `normalize_frequency` parameter to `visualize_topics_per_class` and `visualize_topics_over_time` in order to better compare the relative topic frequencies between topics
* Return flat probabilities as default, only calculate the probabilities of all topics per document if `calculate_probabilities` is True
* Added several FAQs

**Fixes**:  

* Fix loading pre-trained BERTopic model
* Fix mapping of probabilities
* Fix [#190](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/190)


**Guided BERTopic**:    

Guided BERTopic works in two ways: 

First, we create embeddings for each seeded topics by joining them and passing them through the document embedder. 
These embeddings will be compared with the existing document embeddings through cosine similarity and assigned a label. 
If the document is most similar to a seeded topic, then it will get that topic's label. 
If it is most similar to the average document embedding, it will get the -1 label. 
These labels are then passed through UMAP to create a semi-supervised approach that should nudge the topic creation to the seeded topics. 

Second, we take all words in `seed_topic_list` and assign them a multiplier larger than 1. 
Those multipliers will be used to increase the IDF values of the words across all topics thereby increasing 
the likelihood that a seeded topic word will appear in a topic. This does, however, also increase the chance of an 
irrelevant topic having unrelated words. In practice, this should not be an issue since the IDF value is likely to 
remain low regardless of the multiplier. The multiplier is now a fixed value but may change to something more elegant, 
like taking the distribution of IDF values and its position into account when defining the multiplier. 

```python
seed_topic_list = [["company", "billion", "quarter", "shrs", "earnings"],
                   ["acquisition", "procurement", "merge"],
                   ["exchange", "currency", "trading", "rate", "euro"],
                   ["grain", "wheat", "corn"],
                   ["coffee", "cocoa"],
                   ["natural", "gas", "oil", "fuel", "products", "petrol"]]

topic_model = BERTopic(seed_topic_list=seed_topic_list)
topics, probs = topic_model.fit_transform(docs)
```


## **Version 0.8.1**
*Release date:  8 June, 2021*

**Highlights**:  

* Improved models:
    * For English documents the default is now: `"paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2"` 
    * For Non-English or multi-lingual documents the default is now: `"paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2"` 
    * Both models show not only great performance but are much faster!  
* Add interactive visualizations to the `plotting` API documentation
  
For better performance, please use the following models:  

* English: `"paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2"`
* Non-English or multi-lingual: `"paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2"`

**Fixes**:   

* Improved unit testing for more stability
* Set transformers version for Flair

## **Version 0.8.0**

**Fixes**:  

* Fixed issues with Torch req
* Prevent saving term frequency matrix in CTFIDF class
* Fixed DTM not working when reducing topics ([#96](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/96))
* Moved visualization dependencies to base BERTopic
    * `pip install bertopic[visualization]` becomes `pip install bertopic`
* Allow precomputed embeddings in bertopic.find_topics() ([#79](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/79)):
 
```python
model = BERTopic(embedding_model=my_embedding_model)
model.fit(docs, my_precomputed_embeddings)
model.find_topics(search_term)
```

## **Version 0.6.0**
*Release date:  1 March, 2021*

**Highlights**:

* DTM: Added a basic dynamic topic modeling technique based on the global c-TF-IDF representation 
    * `model.topics_over_time(docs, timestamps, global_tuning=True)`
* DTM: Option to evolve topics based on t-1 c-TF-IDF representation which results in evolving topics over time
    * Only uses topics at t-1 and skips evolution if there is a gap
    * `model.topics_over_time(docs, timestamps, evolution_tuning=True)`
* DTM: Function to visualize topics over time 
    * `model.visualize_topics_over_time(topics_over_time)`
* DTM: Add binning of timestamps  
    * `model.topics_over_time(docs, timestamps, nr_bins=10)`
* Add function get general information about topics (id, frequency, name, etc.) 
    *  `get_topic_info()`
* Improved stability of c-TF-IDF by taking the average number of words across all topics instead of the number of documents

**Fixes**:

*  `_map_probabilities()` does not take into account that there is no probability of the outlier class and the probabilities are mutated instead of copied (#63, #64)

## **Version 0.5.0**
*Release date:  8 Februari, 2021*

**Highlights**:
  
* Add `Flair` to allow for more (custom) token/document embeddings, including ðŸ¤— transformers 
* Option to use custom UMAP, HDBSCAN, and CountVectorizer
* Added `low_memory` parameter to reduce memory during computation
* Improved verbosity (shows progress bar)
* Return the figure of `visualize_topics()`
* Expose all parameters with a single function: `get_params()`

**Fixes**:
    
* To simplify the API, the parameters stop_words and n_neighbors were removed. These can still be used when a custom UMAP or CountVectorizer is used.
* Set `calculate_probabilities` to False as a default. Calculating probabilities with HDBSCAN significantly increases computation time and memory usage. Better to remove calculating probabilities or only allow it by manually turning this on.
* Use the newest version of `sentence-transformers` as it speeds ups encoding significantly

## **Version 0.4.2**
*Release date:  10 Januari, 2021*

**Fixes**:  

* Selecting `embedding_model` did not work when `language` was also used. This led to the user needing 
to set `language` to None before being able to use `embedding_model`. Fixed by using `embedding_model` when 
`language` is used (as a default parameter).

## **Version 0.4.1**
*Release date:  07 Januari, 2021*

**Fixes**:  

* Simple fix by lowering the languages variable to match the lowered input language.

## **Version 0.4.0**
*Release date:  21 December, 2020*

**Highlights**:  

* Visualize Topics similar to [LDAvis](https://github.com/cpsievert/LDAvis)
* Added option to reduce topics after training
* Added option to update topic representation after training
* Added option to search topics using a search term
* Significantly improved the stability of generating clusters
* Finetune the topic words by selecting the most coherent words with the highest c-TF-IDF values 
* More extensive tutorials in the documentation

**Notable Changes**:  

* Option to select language instead of sentence-transformers models to minimize the complexity of using BERTopic
* Improved logging (remove duplicates) 
* Check if BERTopic is fitted 
* Added TF-IDF as an embedder instead of transformer models (see tutorial)
* Numpy for Python 3.6 will be dropped and was therefore removed from the workflow.
* Preprocess text before passing it through c-TF-IDF
* Merged `get_topics_freq()` with `get_topic_freq()` 

**Fixes**:  

* Fix error handling topic probabilities

## **Version 0.3.2**
*Release date:  16 November, 2020*

**Highlights**:

* Fixed a bug with the topic reduction method that seems to reduce the number of topics but not to the nr_topics as defined in the class. Since this was, to a certain extend, breaking the topic reduction method a new release was necessary.

## **Version 0.3.1**
*Release date:  4 November, 2020*

**Highlights**:

* Adding the option to use custom embeddings or embeddings that you generated beforehand with whatever package you'd like to use. This allows users to further customize BERTopic to their liking.

## **Version 0.3.0**

## **Version 0.2.0**  
*Release date:  11 October, 2020*

**Highlights**:

- Changed c-TF-IDF procedure such that it implements a version of scikit-learns procedure. This should also speed up the calculation of the sparse matrix and prevent memory errors.
- Added automated unit tests  

## **Version 0.1.2**
*Release date:  1 October, 2020*

**Highlights**:

* When transforming new documents, self.mapped_topics seemed to be missing. Added to the init.

## **Version 0.1.1**
